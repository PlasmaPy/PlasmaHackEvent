# Social Events

Since this year's Hack Week if purely virtual, we're hoping to schedule in
some virtual social time to help gain back the social aspect of in person
events.  We're currently planning of scheduling a social hour for every
day and mechanisms so people can split off into their own working/social
group.  Please stay tuned, and we'll update you with more info.
