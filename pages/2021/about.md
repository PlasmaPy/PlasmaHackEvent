Welcome to the inaugural **Plasma Hack Week**!!  Our first event will be held
remotely from June 28 - July 2, 2021.  The event is **free** and sets out to
increase awareness of open-source software for the Plasma Community:
the benefits it can have on the community, what is currently available, and
how to foster community development of open-source software.  As such, topics will
range from demonstrating and using current open-source plasma software projects
to software engineering skills.  These topics will be presented through both
structured learning activities, such as guided tutorials, and unstructured project
time for collaborative learning.

In the week leading up to the **Plasma Hack Week**, a few more fundamentally
focused tutorials will be presented on topics like the basics of Python, using
version control, contributing to open-source projects, etc.
