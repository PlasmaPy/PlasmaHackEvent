# Plasma Hack Week 2021: Schedule

Each day of **Plasma Hack Week** will be filled with structured tutorial time,
unstructured free hacking time, and social time.  All events in a given day will
not exceed 5 hours, but we highly encourage any breakout discussions that
may be inspired from the day's activities.

This year's Hack Week will be held from June 28 to July 2.  Please stay
tuned to this page, since the refined schedule will be posted here as
the details solidify.

## Prequel tutorials on scientific Python

In the week prior to the Hack Week, we will hold about three hour-long
tutorials that will cover the fundamentals of using Python for science. 
These tutorials are intended for students and scientists who have limited
experience using Python.  We will cover topics such as Python data types,
writing functions, using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) arrays, and plotting
data with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

## Tutorials during the Hack Week

During the Hack Week, we will hold a series of interactive tutorials.
Some of the tutorials will be longer (≳1 hr) to allow an in-depth
introduction to a particular software package or technique.  Likely 
topics include version control with git/GitHub, how to contribute to an
open source software project, getting started with PlasmaPy or OMFIT,
and writing software tests.  We will also hold shorter tutorials 
(∼20–30 min) that will provide an interactive demonstration of the
highlights of a particular software package.

## Lightning talks

A lightning talk is an informal ∼5 minute talk on any topic of interest
to Hack Week participants.  Example topics include a short demo of plasma
software, a hack week project idea, an upcoming event, a suggestion for
improving the culture of the plasma software community, something you
learned during the Hack Week, an upcoming event, or an idea for plasma
software that is yet to be developed.  The time allowed for each
lightning talk will depend on how many people sign up.  There may be
time during the Hack Week to request a lightning talk as well.
