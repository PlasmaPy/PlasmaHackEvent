Welcome to the second **Plasma Hack Week**!!  This year's Hack Week will be
held remotely from July 11 - July 15, 2022.  The event is **free** and will
target three objectives: increasing awareness of open-source software for the
Plasma Community; building a contributor base for open-source software
within the Plasma Community; and **training our scientists so open-source
software can thrive within the Plasma Community**.  These objectives will be
achieved through a hybrid of structured and unstructured learning activities
that we will do as a collaborative group.  So, come prepared to code and have
fun!!!

Based on the feedback from last year's event, we are switching up the
style of the Hack Week.  Instead of being predominately presentation focused,
this year we will be focusing on coding together and learning by doing.  We
will spend the week developing our own `hack` Python package, staring with
the basics (`git` and [GitHub](https://github.com/)) and moving through more
advanced topic throughout the week.  By the end of the week we should have our
own plasma formulary much like the
[`plasmapy.formulary`](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/formulary/index.html).


<!--
In the week leading up to the **Plasma Hack Week**, a few more fundamentally
focused tutorials will be presented on topics like the basics of Python, using 
version control, contributing to open-source projects, etc.
