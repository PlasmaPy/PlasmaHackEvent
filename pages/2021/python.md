# Plasma Hack Week 2021: Pre-Hack-Week Python Tutorials

In the week before the Hack Week, we will host two tutorials to
introduce [Python](https://www.python.org/) to students and scientists
who have not used Python before. These tutorials will be held at 15 UTC
which is 4 pm CET / 11 am EDT / 8 am PDT on Monday, June 21 and Tuesday,
June 22.  Each tutorial will last about an hour.  Please 
[register](./2021/registration) for the Hack Week by Friday, June 18 to
receive connection information for the Python tutorial.

<!---
## Before the workshop

Before the workshop, please follow these instructions to install Python
on your computer.


The tutorials will be adapted from the [Python
tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html)
by Software Carpentry.  


**Please follow the [setup
instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup.html)
before the beginning of the tutorial.** 

If you have difficulty installing or running Python on your computer,
another option is to use this
to spin up an environment with everything installed that you can use
in your web browser.  This option has the disadvantage that if you lose
your internet connection, the information will not be saved.
