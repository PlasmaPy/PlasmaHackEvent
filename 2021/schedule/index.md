# Plasma Hack Week 2021: Schedule

Each day of **Plasma Hack Week** will be filled with structured tutorial time,
unstructured free hacking time, and social time.  All events in a given day will
not exceed 5 hours, but we highly encourage any extend breakout discussions that
may be promoted from the day's activities.

In the week prior to the Hack Week, we will host a few, optional fundamental
tutorials focused on topics related more towards code development and
open-source contribution.

Please stay tuned to this page, since the refined schedule will be posted
here as the details solidify.
