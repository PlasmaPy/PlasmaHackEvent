      "text": "Hello world!  We are pleased to announce that the inaugural Plasma\nHack Week will be held remotely from June 28 \u2013 July 2, 2021.  In the\nweek before the event, we will hold prequel tutorials on topics such\nas Python, git & GitHub, contributing to an open source project, and\nwriting clean scientific software.  \nWhat is a hack week?\nA hack week is a combination\nof a hackathon and a summer school.  While hackathons have traditionally\nprioritized collaborative code development activities, a hack week\nincludes a pedagogical component.  Hack weeks typically have both \nstructured learning activities such as tutorials as well as unstructured\nproject time. A hack week is a chance to:\n\nLearn how to contribute to an open source project;\nLearn new software development skills with peers;\nNetwork with fellow plasma students and researchers who are engaging \n  in software development;\nMeet fellow students and scientists who are engaging in programming;\nCollaborate on adding a new feature to an existing software project;\nAdd tests and/or documentation to an existing package; and/or\nWrite use cases and\n  user stories to support\n  software projects.\n\nJoin our Discord group\nIf you would like to participate or help plan Plasma Hack Week, please\njoin the Plasma Coders group on Discord.\nRegistration\nPlease check soon for registration information. \nCode of conduct\nPlasma Hack Week has adopted the Contributor Covenant Code of\nConduct.\nLicense\nThis website is made available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational (CC BY 4.0)\nlicense.
