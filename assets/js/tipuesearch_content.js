      "text": "Plasma Hack Week 2021\nWelcome to the inaugural Plasma Hack Week!!  Our first event will be held \nremotely from June 28 - July 2, 2021.  The event is free and sets out to \nincrease awareness of open-source software for the Plasma Community:\nthe benefits it can have on the community, what is currently available, and\nhow to foster community development of open-source software.  As such, topics will\nrange from demonstrating and using current open-source plasma software projects\nto software engineering skills.  These topics will be presented through both\nstructured learning activities, such as guided tutorials, and unstructured project\ntime for collaborative learning.\nIn the week leading up to the Plasma Hack Week, a few more fundamentally\nfocused tutorials will be presented on topics like the basics of Python, using \nversion control, contributing to open-source projects, etc.\nFor information on registering please visit our \nregistration page.\nFor information on the schedule and pre-week tutorials please visit our\nscheduling page.\nFor any additional questions please reach out to us on our \nDiscord channel.",

Please stay tuned to this page,\nsince more information will be posted here as the details solidify.  \nPrequel tutorials on scientific Python\nWe will hold two tutorials to introduce Python to \nparticipants who are new to Python.  These tutorials will be held \nthe week before the Hack Week on Monday, June 21 and Tuesday, June 22 at\n15 UTC (4 pm CET / 11 am EDT / 8 am PDT).  Each tutorial will last about\none hour.\nTutorials during the Hack Week\nDuring the Hack Week, we will hold a series of interactive tutorials.\nSome of the tutorials will be longer (\u22731 hr) to allow an in-depth\nintroduction to a particular software package or technique.  Likely \ntopics include version control with git/GitHub, how to contribute to an\nopen source software project, getting started with PlasmaPy or OMFIT,\nand writing software tests.  We will also hold shorter tutorials \n(\u223c30 min) that will provide an interactive demonstration of the\nhighlights of a particular software package.\nLightning talks\nA lightning talk is an informal \u223c5 minute talk on any topic of interest\nto Hack Week participants.  Example topics include a short demo of plasma\nsoftware, a hack week project idea, an upcoming event, a suggestion for\nimproving the culture of the plasma software community, something you\nlearned during the Hack Week, an upcoming event, or an idea for plasma\nsoftware that is yet to be developed.  The time allowed for each\nlightning talk will depend on how many people sign up.  There may be\ntime during the Hack Week to request a lightning talk as well.",

We are pleased to announce that the inaugural Plasma\nHack Week will be held remotely from June 28 \u2013 July 2, 2021.  \nWhat is a hack week and hacking?\nThe term hacking has a broad range of use in modern day slang.  Hacking\nduring the Plasma Hack Week event is seen as a collaborative\ncoding session among novices, experts, and like-minded learners to work \non projects and learn from each other.  Hacking is a learn-by-doing \nactivity, one of the best ways to further our knowledge.\nA hack week is a combination\nof a hackathon (a marathon of hacking) and a summer school.  While \nhackathons have traditionally prioritized collaborative code development\nactivities, a hack week includes a teaching component.  Hack weeks \ntypically have both structured learning activities (such as tutorials) as\nwell as unstructured project time. A hack week is a chance to:\n\nLearn how to contribute to an open source project;\nLearn new software development skills with peers;\nNetwork with fellow plasma students and researchers who are engaging \n  in software development;\nMeet fellow students and scientists who are engaging in programming;\nCollaborate on adding a new feature to an existing software project;\nAdd tests and/or documentation to an existing package; and/or\nWrite use cases and\n  user stories to support\n  software projects.\n\nJoin our Discord group\nIf you would like to participate or help plan Plasma Hack Week, please\njoin the Plasma Coders group on Discord.\nRegistration\nFor information about registering please check out our \n2021 Hack Week registration page.\nPython tutorials\nWe will hold two tutorials to introduce Python to \nparticipants who are new to Python.  These tutorials will be held \nthe week before the Hack Week on Monday, June 21 and Tuesday, June 22 at\n15 UTC (4 pm CET / 11 am EDT / 8 am PDT).\nResources\nWe have compiled resources that are likely to be useful\nfor Hack Week participants.  Topics include Python, git/GitHub, and \nresearch software engineering best practices.\nCode of conduct\nPlasma Hack Week has adopted the Contributor Covenant Code of\nConduct.\nLicense\nThis website is made available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational (CC BY 4.0)\nlicense.
