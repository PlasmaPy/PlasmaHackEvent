# Plasma Hack Week 2021: Social Events

Since this year's Hack Week is purely virtual, and as such, we inherently
loose the social aspect related to in-person events.  In an effort to regain
some the camaraderie, we're currently scheduling social hours for every
day of the event and will provide mechanisms so people can split off into
their own working/social groups.  Please stay tuned, and we'll update you
with more info.  You can also visit our [scheduling page](../schedule).
