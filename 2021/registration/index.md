Registration and attendance for the **Plasma Hack Week** is completely
**FREE**. The registration form will collect basic info so we can
keep you informed about the Hack Week and tailor topics to your
interests, as best as we can, during the unstructured sessions.

The form has an option to propose a **lightning talk** if you are
interested in giving one. A lightning talk is an informal âˆ¼5 minute
talk on any topic of interest to Hack Week participants. Example
topics include a short demo of plasma software, a hack week project
idea, an upcoming event, a suggestion for improving the culture of the
plasma software community, something you learned during the Hack Week,
or an idea for a future event or plasma software that is yet to be
developed.  The time allowed for each lightning talk will depend on
how many people sign up.  There may be time during the Hack Week to
request a lightning talk as well.
