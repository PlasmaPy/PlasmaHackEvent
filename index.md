Hello world!  We are pleased to announce that the inaugural **Plasma
Hack Week** will be held remotely from June 28 â€“ July 2, 2021.  In the
week before the event, we will hold two [prequel
tutorials](./2021/python) that will introduce the essentials of Python. 

## What is a hack week and hacking?

The term hacking has a broad range of use in modern day slang.  Hacking
during the **Plasma Hack Week** event is seen as a collaborative
coding session among novices, experts, and like-minded learners to work 
on projects and learn from each other.  Hacking is a learn-by-doing 
activity, one of the best ways to further our knowledge.

A [hack week](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1717196115) is a combination
of a hackathon (a marathon of hacking) and a summer school.  While 
hackathons have traditionally prioritized collaborative code development
activities, a hack week includes a teaching component.  Hack weeks 
typically have both structured learning activities (such as tutorials) as
well as unstructured project time. A hack week is a chance to:
 
- Learn how to contribute to an open source project;
- Learn new software development skills with peers;
- Network with fellow plasma students and researchers who are engaging 
  in software development;
- Meet fellow students and scientists who are engaging in programming;
- Collaborate on adding a new feature to an existing software project;
- Add tests and/or documentation to an existing package; and/or
- Write [use cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) and
  [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) to support
  software projects.
