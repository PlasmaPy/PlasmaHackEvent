Hello world!  We are pleased to announce that the inaugural **Plasma
Hack Week** will be held remotely from June 28 – July 2, 2021.  In the
week before the event, we will hold prequel tutorials on topics such
as Python, git & GitHub, contributing to an open source project, and
writing clean scientific software.  

## What is a hack week?

A [hack week](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1717196115) is a combination
of a hackathon and a summer school.  While hackathons have traditionally
prioritized collaborative code development activities, a hack week
includes a pedagogical component.  Hack weeks typically have both 
structured learning activities such as tutorials as well as unstructured
project time. A hack week is a chance to:
 
- Learn how to contribute to an open source project;
- Learn new software development skills with peers;
- Network with fellow plasma students and researchers who are engaging 
  in software development;
- Meet fellow students and scientists who are engaging in programming;
- Collaborate on adding a new feature to an existing software project;
- Add tests and/or documentation to an existing package; and/or
- Write [use cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) and
  [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) to support
  software projects.
