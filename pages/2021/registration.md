Registration and attendance for the **Plasma Hack Week** is completely **FREE**.
The registration form will collect basic info, so we can keep you informed about
the Hack Week and tailor topics to your interests, as best as we can, during the
unstructured sessions.

The form has an additional optional section for proposing a "lightning talk" 
if you are interested in giving one.  A "lightning talk" is a short, 5-10 min,
presentation on any topic you find of interest and is relevant to the
**Plasma Hack Week**.
