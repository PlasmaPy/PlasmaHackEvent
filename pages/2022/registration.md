Registration and attendance for the **Plasma Hack Week** is completely **FREE**.
The registration form will collect basic info, so we can keep you informed about
the Hack Week and tailor topics to your interests, as best as we can, during the
event.

The registration form has an option to propose a **lightning talk** if you
are interested in giving one. A lightning talk is a short, informal
talk on any topic of interest to Hack Week participants.

<!--
For more information on lightning talks, see the [schedule page](../schedule).
