      "text": "Plasma Hack Week 2021\nWelcome to the inaugural Plasma Hack Week!!  Our first event will be held \nremotely from June 28 - July 2, 2021.  The event is free and sets out to \nincrease awareness of open-source software for the Plasma Community:\nthe benefits it can have on the community, what is currently available, and\nhow to foster community development of open-source software.  As such, topics will\nrange from demonstrating and using current open-source plasma software projects\nto software engineering skills.  These topics will be presented through both\nstructured learning activities, such as guided tutorials, and unstructured project\ntime for collaborative learning.\nIn the week leading up to the Plasma Hack Week, a few more fundamentally\nfocused tutorials will be presented on topics like the basics of Python, using \nversion control, contributing to open-source projects, etc.\nFor information on registering please visit our \nregistration page.\nFor information on the schedule and pre-week tutorials please visit our\nscheduling page.\nFor any additional questions please reach out to us on our \nDiscord channel.",

These\n        tutorials are geared towards participants new to Python.\n    \n    \n        For further details please see the prequel section\n        below and/or the Python tutorial page.\n    \n\n\nEach day of Plasma Hack Week will be filled with structured tutorial\ntime, social time, and unstructured free hacking time.  All pre-planned\nevents will not exceed 5 hours in any given day, and we highly encourage\nany breakout discussions and hack sessions that may be inspired from the\nday's activities.\nThis year's Hack Week will be held from June 28 to July 2.  Each day is divided\ninto two 2-hour sessions split between a social hour, see\nthe schedule below for details.\n\nFirst Session\nThis session is geared towards tutorials and lightning talks with\n the option for any inspired discussions as we move into the social hour.\nSocial Hour\nThe social hour is intended for participants to use as they like, but we\n highly encourage participants to use this time to interact and discuss\n with other participants.  During this time the Hack Week organizers\n will sit in the main meeting to be available for any discussions, but\n we will also have several breakout rooms available.  These breakout\n rooms are so participants can have more focused discussions amongst\n themselves.\nSecond Session\nThe second session is focused more towards open hacking/coding and\n discussions.  The session will start off with a specific topic\n to get the ball rolling and then will be opened up to any topics\n participants are interested in.\n\nDuring the social hour or second session we highly encourage participants\nto schedule additional events.  If this is something you are interested\nin, then please announce and organize it on Discord.  We will do our best\nto facilitate a breakout room for you.\n The schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Prequel tutorials on scientific Python\nWe will hold two tutorials to introduce Python to \nparticipants who are new to Python.

Each tutorial will last about\none hour.\nTypes of talks\n\n\nTutorials during the Hack Week\nDuring the Hack Week, we will hold a series of interactive tutorials.\nSome of the tutorials will be longer (\u22731 hr) to allow an in-depth\nintroduction to a particular software package or technique.  Likely \ntopics include version control with git/GitHub, how to contribute to an\nopen source software project, getting started with PlasmaPy or OMFIT,\nand writing software tests.  We will also hold shorter tutorials \n(\u223c30 min) that will provide an interactive demonstration of the\nhighlights of a particular software package.\nLightning talks\nA lightning talk is an informal \u223c5 minute talk on any topic of interest\nto Hack Week participants.  Example topics include a short demo of plasma\nsoftware, a hack week project idea, an upcoming event, a suggestion for\nimproving the culture of the plasma software community, something you\nlearned during the Hack Week, an upcoming event, or an idea for plasma\nsoftware that is yet to be developed.  The time allowed for each\nlightning talk will depend on how many people sign up.  There may be\ntime during the Hack Week to request a lightning talk as well.",

We are pleased to announce that the inaugural Plasma\nHack Week will be held remotely from June 28 \u2013 July 2, 2021.  \nWhat is a hack week and hacking?\nThe term hacking has a broad range of use in modern day slang.  Hacking\nduring the Plasma Hack Week event is seen as a collaborative\ncoding session among novices, experts, and like-minded learners to work \non projects and learn from each other.  Hacking is a learn-by-doing \nactivity, one of the best ways to further our knowledge.\nA hack week is a combination\nof a hackathon (a marathon of hacking) and a summer school.  While \nhackathons have traditionally prioritized collaborative code development\nactivities, a hack week includes a teaching component.  Hack weeks \ntypically have both structured learning activities (such as tutorials) as\nwell as unstructured project time. A hack week is a chance to:\n\nLearn how to contribute to an open source project;\nLearn new software development skills with peers;\nNetwork with fellow plasma students and researchers who are engaging \n  in software development;\nMeet fellow students and scientists who are engaging in programming;\nCollaborate on adding a new feature to an existing software project;\nAdd tests and/or documentation to an existing package; and/or\nWrite use cases and\n  user stories to support\n  software projects.\n\nJoin our Discord group\nIf you would like to participate or help plan Plasma Hack Week, please\njoin the Plasma Coders group on Discord.\nRegistration\nFor information about registering please check out our \n2021 Hack Week registration page.\nPython tutorials\nWe will hold two tutorials to introduce Python to \nparticipants who are new to Python.  These tutorials will be held \nthe week before the Hack Week on Monday, June 21 and Tuesday, June 22 at\n15 UTC (4 pm CET / 11 am EDT / 8 am PDT).\nResources\nWe have compiled resources that are likely to be useful\nfor Hack Week participants.  Topics include Python, git/GitHub, and \nresearch software engineering best practices.\nCode of conduct\nPlasma Hack Week has adopted the Contributor Covenant Code of\nConduct.\nLicense\nThis website is made available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational (CC BY 4.0)\nlicense.
