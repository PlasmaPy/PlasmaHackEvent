# Plasma Hack Week 2021: Schedule

Each day of **Plasma Hack Week** will be filled with structured tutorial
time, social time, and unstructured free hacking time.  All pre-planned
events will not exceed 5 hours in any given day, and we highly encourage
any breakout discussions and hack sessions that may be inspired from the
day's activities.

This year's Hack Week will be held from June 28 to July 2.  The main 
events each day will be:

 * A two-hour session with tutorials, lightning talks, and group discussion
   from 15:00–17:00 UTC (3–5 pm CET, 11 am – 1 pm ET, 8–10 am PT)
 * A one-hour informal social hour from 17:00–18:00 UTC 
   (5–6 pm CET, 1–2 pm ET, 10–11 am PT)
 * A two-hour hack session from 18:00–20:00 UTC
   (6–8 pm CET, 2–4 pm ET, 11 am – 1 pm PT)
   
We encourage participants to schedule additional events during the hack
week, and announce them on Discord. Please stay tuned to this page,
since more information will be posted here as the details solidify.  

## Prequel tutorials on scientific Python

We will hold two [tutorials to introduce Python](./2021/python) to 
participants who are new to Python.  These tutorials will be held 
the week before the Hack Week on Monday, June 21 and Tuesday, June 22 at
15 UTC (4 pm CET / 11 am EDT / 8 am PDT).  Each tutorial will last about
one hour.

## Tutorials during the Hack Week

During the Hack Week, we will hold a series of interactive tutorials.
Some of the tutorials will be longer (≳1 hr) to allow an in-depth
introduction to a particular software package or technique.  Likely 
topics include version control with git/GitHub, how to contribute to an
open source software project, getting started with PlasmaPy or OMFIT,
and writing software tests.  We will also hold shorter tutorials 
(∼30 min) that will provide an interactive demonstration of the
highlights of a particular software package.

## Lightning talks

A lightning talk is an informal ∼5 minute talk on any topic of interest
to Hack Week participants.  Example topics include a short demo of plasma
software, a hack week project idea, an upcoming event, a suggestion for
improving the culture of the plasma software community, something you
learned during the Hack Week, an upcoming event, or an idea for plasma
software that is yet to be developed.  The time allowed for each
lightning talk will depend on how many people sign up.  There may be
time during the Hack Week to request a lightning talk as well.
