Each day of **Plasma Hack Week** will be filled with structured tutorial
time, social time, and unstructured free hacking time. All pre-planned
events will not exceed 5 hours in any given day, and we highly encourage
any breakout discussions and hack sessions that may be inspired from the
day's activities.

This year's Hack Week will be held from June 28 to July 2. Each day is divided
into two 2-hour sessions split between a social hour, see
[the schedule](#the-schedule) below for details.

First Session
: This session is geared towards tutorials and lightning talks with
the option for any inspired discussions as we move into the social hour.

Social Hour
: The social hour is intended for participants to use as they like, but we
highly encourage participants to use this time to interact and discuss
with other participants. During this time the Hack Week organizers
will sit in the main meeting to be available for any discussions, but
we will also have several breakout rooms available. These breakout
rooms are so participants can have more focused discussions amongst
themselves.

Second Session
: The second session is focused more towards open hacking/coding and
discussions. The session will start off with a specific topic
to get the ball rolling and then will be opened up to any topics
participants are interested in.

During the social hour or second session we highly encourage participants
to schedule additional events. If this is something you are interested
in, then please announce and organize it on Discord. We will do our best
to facilitate a breakout room for you.

## <a name="prequel"></a> Prequel tutorials on scientific Python

We will hold two [tutorials to introduce Python](../python) to
participants who are new to Python. These tutorials will be held
the week before the Hack Week on Monday, June 21 and Tuesday, June 22 at
15 UTC (5 pm CEST / 11 am EDT / 8 am PDT). Each tutorial will last about
one hour.

## Types of talks

### Tutorials during the Hack Week

During the Hack Week, we will hold a series of interactive tutorials.
Some of the tutorials will be longer (≳1 hr) to allow an in-depth
introduction to a particular software package or technique. Likely
topics include version control with git/GitHub, how to contribute to an
open source software project, getting started with PlasmaPy or OMFIT,
and writing software tests. We will also hold shorter tutorials
(∼30 min) that will provide an interactive demonstration of the
highlights of a particular software package.

### Lightning talks

A lightning talk is an informal ∼5 minute talk on any topic of interest
to Hack Week participants. Example topics include a short demo of plasma
software, a hack week project idea, an upcoming event, a suggestion for
improving the culture of the plasma software community, something you
learned during the Hack Week, an upcoming event, or an idea for plasma
software that is yet to be developed. The time allowed for each
lightning talk will depend on how many people sign up. There may be
time during the Hack Week to request a lightning talk as well.
